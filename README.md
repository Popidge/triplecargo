📤 Training data export (JSONL)

Overview
- Export solver-labelled states to JSONL for training and analysis.
- Two export modes:
  - --export-mode trajectory (default): emits a single 9-state principal-variation trajectory per sampled game.
  - --export-mode full: emits the entire reachable state space for one sampled hand pair (exhaustive).
- Deterministic by design: same seed+flags → identical output (including elements layout, off-PV behaviour, and policy/value targets).

Core flags
- Output and mode
  - --export PATH                JSONL output file
  - --export-mode trajectory|full
  - --games N                    number of games (trajectory mode only; full mode ignores this)
- Parallelism and scheduling
  - --threads N                  number of worker threads (default: available_parallelism()-1, min 1)
  - --chunk-size N               number of games each worker fetches at once; if omitted, defaults to min(32, max(1, floor(games/threads))); affects scheduling only
- Sampling and determinism
  - --seed U64                   master seed; controls hand sampling, per-ply RNG (off-PV), and MCTS rollouts
  - --hand-strategy random|stratified
  - --rules elemental,same,plus,same_wall (or 'none')
  - --elements none|random       element layout (random is deterministic per game)
- Policy and value targets
  - --policy-format onehot|mcts
  - --mcts-rollouts N            rollouts used when --policy-format mcts (default 100)
  - --value-mode winloss|margin
- Off-PV stepping (trajectory mode only)
  - --off-pv-rate FLOAT [0..1]   per-game probability of off-PV stepping (0 disables)
  - --off-pv-strategy random|weighted|mcts
    - random: uniform over legal non-PV moves; if no alternative, fall back to PV.
    - weighted: softmax over root child negamax Q values; PV mass set to 0, renormalised, then sampled.
    - mcts: reuse root MCTS distribution when policy_format=mcts; otherwise compute root MCTS with --mcts-rollouts and sample after zeroing PV.

- Transposition table (per worker)
  - --tt-bytes N               TT size per worker in MiB (default 32). Capacity is rounded down to the nearest power-of-two entries that fit under the requested budget. Applies to both trajectory and full export modes. Total memory usage ≈ workers × tt-bytes.
Parallel export (worker + writer) — TASK T7
- The export pipeline now supports an explicit worker + writer model (replacing the previous Rayon pool).
- New CLI flag: --threads N (default: available_parallelism()-1). Workers claim game indices via an atomic counter and operate deterministically.
- Worker behavior:
  - Deterministically sample hands/elements from the master seed and game id.
  - For each game produce 9 JSONL lines by running full-depth solver searches (using search_root_with_children() for policy Q values).
  - Send (game_id, Vec<String>) to the single writer thread.
- Writer behavior:
  - Single dedicated writer receives per-game line blocks, buffers out-of-order arrivals, and writes games in strict increasing game_id order to maintain byte-for-byte determinism across different thread counts.
- Determinism guarantees:
  - With identical seed + flags the JSONL output is byte-for-byte identical whether --threads=1 or --threads>1.
  - Tests: --games 10 produces 90 lines; output compared equal across thread counts.
- Progress:
  - The trajectory export includes an indicatif ProgressBar with a background updater that reports states/sec, nodes/sec, ETA, and policy info.

Chunked scheduling — TASK T9
- New CLI flag: --chunk-size N (dynamic default).
- Default behaviour when --chunk-size is omitted:
  - effective_chunk_size = min(32, max(1, floor(games/threads))).
  - This keeps small runs snappy (smaller chunks) while avoiding excessive overhead on large runs (cap at 32).
- Scheduling model:
  - Each worker requests N games at a time (a "chunk") from a deterministic round‑robin dispatcher.
  - Mapping is round‑based: in round r, worker w processes chunk index (r * workers + w).
  - For a chunk index k, the assigned game_id range is [k*N, min((k+1)*N, games)).
  - Workers solve games in their chunk sequentially, then proceed to their next round’s chunk.
- Determinism:
  - Assignment is a pure function of (worker_id, worker_count, chunk_size), not timing.
  - The single writer preserves strict increasing game_id order, so JSONL output is byte‑for‑byte identical for the same seed + flags regardless of --chunk-size and --threads.
  - game_id stability is preserved across different chunk sizes and thread counts.
- Logging:
  - At startup, export logs include the configured chunk size:
    [export] chunk_size=N
- Trade‑offs:
  - Larger chunks reduce scheduling overhead and improve locality for per‑worker TT warming.
  - Smaller chunks can improve tail latency and load balance for heterogeneous workloads.
  - Chunking affects scheduling only; output content and ordering are unchanged.

Per-worker transposition table — TASK T8
- Each worker owns a fixed-size, direct-mapped transposition table (no sharing; no locks).
- Default budget is 32 MiB per worker; configurable via --tt-bytes N (MiB).
- Warming: in trajectory mode, a worker keeps its TT alive across all games it processes to maximise reuse.
- Full mode uses a single TT of the same budget for the entire DFS export.
- Rounding rule: the requested budget is rounded down to the largest power-of-two capacity that fits. Effective bytes are approximately capacity × entry_size.
- Memory formula: total TT memory ≈ workers × tt-bytes.
- Determinism: with identical seed + flags, output is byte-for-byte identical regardless of --tt-bytes (TT size does not influence labels).
- Startup logs (one line per worker) show the chosen capacity, e.g.:
  [worker 0] TT target=32 MiB capacity=8388608 entries ≈31.9 MiB
Determinism specifics
- Trajectory mode:
  - Labels (policy/value) are computed from full-depth perfect play at each ply; labels remain PV-optimal regardless of stepping strategy.
  - Off-PV stepping uses a per-ply RNG derived from (seed, game_id, turn) for deterministic sampling.
- Full mode:
  - Enumeration is deterministic. For optional MCTS policy distributions in full mode, rollout RNG derives from (seed XOR state_zobrist) to preserve traversal-order invariance.
- With identical seeds and flags, the exported JSONL is byte-for-byte identical.

🧪 Single-state evaluation (stdin → stdout)

Evaluate a single game state JSON via the precompute binary. Reads exactly one JSON object from stdin and writes exactly one JSON object to stdout. Deterministic: same input → identical output (including PV order).

Export semantics

State timing
- Each JSONL line represents the state before a move is made.
- At turn = t, the board has t occupied cells; the side in to_move will play their (t+1)-th card next.
- Hands shrink accordingly; at the final turn = 8 there is still one card left (and a policy_target showing where it will be placed).

Policy targets
- --policy-format onehot:
  - Exported as a single best-move object:
    "policy_target": {"card_id": 34, "cell": 0}
- --policy-format mcts:
  - Exported as a {"cardId-cell": prob} map over legal moves:
    "policy_target": {"34-0": 0.7, "56-1": 0.3}
- Terminal states:
  - onehot → policy_target omitted (null).
  - mcts → empty map {}.

Off-PV stepping (trajectory mode)
- Labels remain PV-optimal: policy/value targets reflect perfect play; stepping only affects which move is played next to advance the trajectory.
- Per-game activation: with probability --off-pv-rate a game uses off-PV stepping for all its plies.
- Strategies:
  - random:
    - Uniform over legal non-PV moves. If no alternative exists, fall back to the PV move (or None at terminal).
  - weighted:
    - Use root child negamax values (Q). Compute softmax(Q), set PV move probability to 0, renormalise, sample with a deterministic RNG derived from (seed, game_id, turn).
    - If no alternative exists, fall back to PV.
  - mcts:
    - If --policy-format mcts, reuse the root MCTS distribution computed for policy_target; otherwise compute a fresh root MCTS with --mcts-rollouts (deterministic per-ply seed).
    - Set PV probability to 0, renormalise, sample deterministically.
    - Fallback: if the PV move had all probability mass (sum of non-PV probs == 0), select the highest-probability non-PV move deterministically.

Play strategy and heuristic mixing (trajectory mode)
- New play selector, configured via --play-strategy pv|mcts|heuristic|mix (default: mix).
  - pv: always play the principal-variation move.
  - mcts: sample from the MCTS root distribution when --policy-format mcts; otherwise falls back to pv/off-pv.
  - heuristic: sample from a lightweight heuristic distribution (see weights below).
  - mix: per-ply mixture of PV, Heuristic, and optional MCTS; early plies are heuristic‑heavier and late plies PV‑heavier.
- Progressive schedule flags:
  - --mix-heuristic-early FLOAT (default 0.65)
  - --mix-heuristic-late FLOAT (default 0.10)
  - --mix-mcts FLOAT (default 0.25 when --policy-format mcts, otherwise ignored)
- Heuristic feature weights (configurable):
  - --heur-w-corner (default 1.0), --heur-w-edge (0.3), --heur-w-center (-0.2)
  - --heur-w-greedy (0.8): immediate margin gain from the mover’s perspective after simulating the move using apply_move in [src/engine/apply.rs](src/engine/apply.rs:224)
  - --heur-w-defense (0.6): exposure/vulnerability vs neighbours using adjusted sides like in [adjusted_sides_for_cell](src/engine/apply.rs:33)
  - --heur-w-element (0.6): element synergy penalties/bonuses based on Board::cell_element in [src/board.rs](src/board.rs:56)
- Determinism: sampling uses rng_for_state(seed, game_id, turn) in [src/rng.rs](src/rng.rs:12). The policy/value labels still come from perfect play using [search_root_with_children()](src/solver/negamax.rs:98); mixing affects only which move advances the trajectory.
- Interplay with off-PV:
  - When --play-strategy=mix, off-PV flags are ignored (mix governs diversity deterministically).
  - For --play-strategy=pv|mcts|heuristic, existing --off-pv-rate/--off-pv-strategy behaviour is preserved.
- Implementation entry points:
  - Mixed selector logic: choose_next_move_mixed in [src/bin/precompute.rs](src/bin/precompute.rs:877)
  - MCTS policy distribution: mcts_policy_distribution in [src/bin/precompute.rs](src/bin/precompute.rs:381)
  - Root Q-values for policy/labels: search_root_with_children in [src/solver/negamax.rs](src/solver/negamax.rs:98)

Value targets
- --value-mode winloss:
  - value ∈ {-1, 0, +1}, always from side-to-move perspective.
    - +1 = side-to-move wins under perfect play
    - 0  = draw
    - −1 = side-to-move loses
- --value-mode margin:
  - integer final score difference (A_cards − B_cards), always from A’s perspective, independent of who is to move.
- Values are computed by solving the full remaining depth at each ply, so they match final outcomes.

Elements
- When rules.elemental = true, each board cell includes an "element" field with one of: F, I, T, W, E, P, H, L.
- Otherwise the "element" field is omitted.

Metadata
- game_id: sequential per sampled game (trajectory); 0 in full mode.
- state_idx: 0..8 within a trajectory (equals turn).
- off_pv: true for all lines of off-PV games; false otherwise.
- state_hash: 128‑bit Zobrist hash of the state, hex string.
