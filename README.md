♠️ Triplecargo — Triple Triad Assistant & Solver (FF8)

Deterministic, high‑performance Rust implementation of the Final Fantasy VIII Triple Triad ruleset, designed to support:

- Perfect play solving (Negamax + αβ + TT).
- Full state‑space precomputation for instant queries.
- Analysis experiments (first‑player advantage, card ratings, rule impacts).
- AI/ML integration for lightweight move suggestion and imperfect‑information play.
Triplecargo is both a research‑grade solver and the foundation for a superhuman Triple Triad assistant — combining exact computation with modern AI techniques.

📤 Training data export (JSONL)

Overview
- Export solver-labelled states to JSONL for training and analysis.
- Two export modes:
  - --export-mode trajectory (default): emits a single 9-state principal-variation trajectory per sampled game.
  - --export-mode full: emits the entire reachable state space for one sampled hand pair (exhaustive).
- Deterministic by design: same seed+flags → identical output (including elements layout, off-PV behaviour, and policy/value targets).

Core flags
- Output and mode
  - --export PATH                JSONL output file
  - --export-mode trajectory|full
  - --games N                    number of games (trajectory mode only; full mode ignores this)
- Sampling and determinism
  - --seed U64                   master seed; controls hand sampling, per-ply RNG (off-PV), and MCTS rollouts
  - --hand-strategy random|stratified
  - --rules elemental,same,plus,same_wall (or 'none')
  - --elements none|random       element layout (random is deterministic per game)
- Policy and value targets
  - --policy-format onehot|mcts
  - --mcts-rollouts N            rollouts used when --policy-format mcts (default 100)
  - --value-mode winloss|margin
- Off-PV stepping (trajectory mode only)
  - --off-pv-rate FLOAT [0..1]   per-game probability of off-PV stepping (0 disables)
  - --off-pv-strategy random|weighted|mcts
    - random: uniform over legal non-PV moves; if no alternative, fall back to PV.
    - weighted: softmax over root child negamax Q values; PV mass set to 0, renormalised, then sampled.
    - mcts: reuse root MCTS distribution when policy_format=mcts; otherwise compute root MCTS with --mcts-rollouts and sample after zeroing PV.

Parallel export (worker + writer) — TASK T7
- The export pipeline now supports an explicit worker + writer model (replacing the previous Rayon pool).
- New CLI flag: --threads N (default: available_parallelism()-1). Workers claim game indices via an atomic counter and operate deterministically.
- Worker behavior:
  - Deterministically sample hands/elements from the master seed and game id.
  - For each game produce 9 JSONL lines by running full-depth solver searches (using search_root_with_children() for policy Q values).
  - Send (game_id, Vec<String>) to the single writer thread.
- Writer behavior:
  - Single dedicated writer receives per-game line blocks, buffers out-of-order arrivals, and writes games in strict increasing game_id order to maintain byte-for-byte determinism across different thread counts.
- Determinism guarantees:
  - With identical seed + flags the JSONL output is byte-for-byte identical whether --threads=1 or --threads>1.
  - Tests: --games 10 produces 90 lines; output compared equal across thread counts.
- Progress:
  - The trajectory export includes an indicatif ProgressBar with a background updater that reports states/sec, nodes/sec, ETA, and policy info.

Determinisim specifics
- Trajectory mode:
  - Labels (policy/value) are computed from full-depth perfect play at each ply; labels remain PV-optimal regardless of stepping strategy.
  - Off-PV stepping uses a per-ply RNG derived from (seed, game_id, turn) for deterministic sampling.
- Full mode:
  - Enumeration is deterministic. For optional MCTS policy distributions in full mode, rollout RNG derives from (seed XOR state_zobrist) to preserve traversal-order invariance.
- With identical seeds and flags, the exported JSONL is byte-for-byte identical.

Export semantics

State timing
- Each JSONL line represents the state before a move is made.
- At turn = t, the board has t occupied cells; the side in to_move will play their (t+1)-th card next.
- Hands shrink accordingly; at the final turn = 8 there is still one card left (and a policy_target showing where it will be placed).

Policy targets
- --policy-format onehot:
  - Exported as a single best-move object:
    "policy_target": {"card_id": 34, "cell": 0}
- --policy-format mcts:
  - Exported as a {"cardId-cell": prob} map over legal moves:
    "policy_target": {"34-0": 0.7, "56-1": 0.3}
- Terminal states:
  - onehot → policy_target omitted (null).
  - mcts → empty map {}.

Off-PV stepping (trajectory mode)
- Labels remain PV-optimal: policy/value targets reflect perfect play; stepping only affects which move is played next to advance the trajectory.
- Per-game activation: with probability --off-pv-rate a game uses off-PV stepping for all its plies.
- Strategies:
  - random:
    - Uniform over legal non-PV moves. If no alternative exists, fall back to the PV move (or None at terminal).
  - weighted:
    - Use root child negamax values (Q). Compute softmax(Q), set PV move probability to 0, renormalise, sample with a deterministic RNG derived from (seed, game_id, turn).
    - If no alternative exists, fall back to PV.
  - mcts:
    - If --policy-format mcts, reuse the root MCTS distribution computed for policy_target; otherwise compute a fresh root MCTS with --mcts-rollouts (deterministic per-ply seed).
    - Set PV probability to 0, renormalise, sample deterministically.
    - Fallback: if the PV move had all probability mass (sum of non-PV probs == 0), select the highest-probability non-PV move deterministically.

Value targets
- --value-mode winloss:
  - value ∈ {-1, 0, +1}, always from side-to-move perspective.
    - +1 = side-to-move wins under perfect play
    - 0  = draw
    - −1 = side-to-move loses
- --value-mode margin:
  - integer final score difference (A_cards − B_cards), always from A’s perspective, independent of who is to move.
- Values are computed by solving the full remaining depth at each ply, so they match final outcomes.

Elements
- When rules.elemental = true, each board cell includes an "element" field with one of: F, I, T, W, E, P, H, L.
- Otherwise the "element" field is omitted.

Metadata
- game_id: sequential per sampled game (trajectory); 0 in full mode.
- state_idx: 0..8 within a trajectory (equals turn).
- off_pv: true for all lines of off-PV games; false otherwise.
- state_hash: 128‑bit Zobrist hash of the state, hex string.
